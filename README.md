# nemADSQ
A repository containing pipelines for nematode genome assembly, decontamination, scaffolding, and QC.

## Requirements
Most requirements will be satisfied automatically by nextflow using the conda environment specification, but requires Red (REpeat Detector) which you can get [http://toolsmith.ens.utulsa.edu](http://toolsmith.ens.utulsa.edu). Install one of the pre-built binaries for your system or build from source. The `Red` executable needs to be in your $PATH.
